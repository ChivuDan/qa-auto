## Axway Romania QA Automation Interview

Inside this project you will find two classes, *Graph*, *GraphTraversal*, which are functional, and a *Main* class which you can use as a driver for the project.

You will have **4** tasks that need to be implemented:

1. Implement a method that can take as input an arbitrary *Graph* and returns its Depth First Traversal.
2. Implement a REST API with basic CRUD functionalities over this application. You are free to use any database system or just simply write to a file.
3. Create a new class, *Tree* which extends *Graph*, that has the functionality of a classic tree.
4. Design any tests for this application that you see fit. You must include at least one unit test and one integration test.

Upload all the code to a git repository which can be accessed by us.
